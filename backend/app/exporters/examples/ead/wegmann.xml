            <p>Edward Wegmann Jr. was a special lecturer in the School of Engineering of the University of the City of New York (now New York University) during the 1892-1893 and 1893-1894 academic years. He received a degree in civil engineering from the University in 1871. He was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and educated in Zurich, Switzerland, and at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. According to an obituary from 
                <title render="italic">The New York Times</title> dated January 5, 1935, he helped in the construction of the New Haven and Middleton, New York and New England and the West Shore Railroads. He later worked for the elevated railroads in New York City. He was appointed assistant engineer to the New York Aqueduct Commission in 1884. He published several monographs on the design and construction of masonry dams as well as a history of New York City waterworks from 1658 to 1895. He was one of the engineers for the tunnel of the Croton Aqueduct under the Harlem River. From 1910 to 1914 he was consulting engineer to the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity. He died January 4, 1935, in Yonkers, N.Y. at the age of 84.</p>
